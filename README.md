This is currently the first prototype for a open source Field-Oriented Control Electronic Speed Controller.

I am currently designing it to be able to drive 300w motors at 12v (or 3s).

This doesnt mean these are limitation. With good cooling they should be able to handle quite a bit more.

It's designed to be used on a robotic arm I'm working on.

For Groundplane:
the template gives a 404
